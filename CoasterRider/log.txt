2012:Aug:15:AM:01:43
	+	added some track functions and yesterday i added track mesh.
	+	track length now seems to work
2012:Aug:15:PM:08:11
	+	track draws now, but it takes too long to wrap the spline to the mesh points
	+	consider some type of lookup table for mapping progress to up vectors
		(use approximation if needed. )
	+	TODO: Make  a heading approximation table for distance progressions along the track.  
	+	TODO: make a similar point approximation table with more entries.
	+	TODO: give Track::GetElmtStartHeadingAndPt() an extra boolean flag parameter to 
			   use a lookup table or not
	+	TODO: make a table for element start headings and 
	+	TODO: add a boolean flag parameter to Track::GetElmtStartHeadingAndPt() to use 
				a lookup table or not.
2012:Aug:17:PM:07:52
	+	Added tables to optimize the spline wrapping (still somewhat slow)
	+	added TrackMesh::UpdateNormals() to be called in accordance with spline wrapper.
	+	Fixed camera and lighting
	+	Defined some splines for hills and quarter turns.
	+	Added startbank to Track class and exitbank to PathSpline.  
	+	NOTE: banking will not affect the permanent orientation of the spline from element 
	   to element, but will affect heading of track and vehicle at any given point along 
	   the track.
	+	TODO: apply the new banking values to GetHeadingAt function somehow.
	+	TODO: fix the corkscrew up vectors.  They look off...
	+	TODO: Distance2Scale in PathSpline
2012:Aug:19:AM:03:02
	+	finally added the project to github under "DreamCoasterRider"
	+	TODO: need to add supports next.  These should be easy:
		[]	just check intervals along the track for up vectors have positive Y values.
		[]	on positive Y-valued up vectors, move DOWN the up vector a little (it should 
		   touch the track, and add a vertical support tube mesh from that point to the 
		   ground.
		[] Just put all the code in a TrackMesh::AddSupport() function with progress point
			and color as the primary arguments. 
	+	added a sky bowl.
	+	added a flat terrain.  both were easy to do in irrlicht.
	+	it is already looking like a real track.  gotta keep going though.
2012:Aug:20:AM:09:46
	+	added displays for speed, position and track length
	+	TODO: I added full circuit code, but i need to fix the lengths.  It freezes at the end of the track.  
2012:Aug:22:AM:03:47
	+	Tried multiple tracks in one scene.  Got really slow after 5 or so.
	+	The track length is better, but still has a way to go.
	+	Still need to do a Distance2Scale in FullSpline.  spline scale is not consistent with linear distance.
		I think using the ratios of three control point spans (|AB|,|BC|,|CD|) to the total span would 
		be close enough of an approximation without being too slow.
2012:Aug:28:AM:05:15
	+	TrackOperator class added, along with Train, Block, and Car classes.  
	+	TrackOperator::MoveTrain() handles the physics for now...
	+	Haven't yet updated the camera to move with the new Functions.  Still some things to test and take 
	   care of.
	+	TODO: need to process time in milliseconds and pass the time elapsed to TrackOperator::MoveTrain().
		Maybe Irrlicht has something for this
2012:Aug:29:AM:06:56
	+	Changed the physics to accelerate based on track slope.
	+	Pressing 0..3 on the keyboard changes the timer speed. 
			0 pauses, 3 goes 16x, 1 goes normal speed.
	+	added blocks functions to TrackOperator to test for a train	in block.
	+	lift blocks and the new physics now allow rollback.
2012:Aug:30:AM:07:24
	+	Adjusted the track pattern using a "head height".  This was done to make barrel rolls more easily.  It 
	   messes up corkscrews though, and doesn't make barrel rolls perfect.
	+	Rearranged TrackFactory class.  Put element definitions in a new function.  Made a corkscrew creator.
	+	TODO: fix barrel rolls and corkscrews so they don't "bump" upon entry and exit.  Perhaps increase 
		control point span?
2012:Aug:31:PM:12:09
	+	removed the head height track displacement for now.  
	+	added gradual acceleration for lifts and launches.
	+	added some new element definitions and a top hat launched track factory creation method.
2012:Sep:01:AM:06:48
	+	added a track file parser.  Now XML files can define tracks ( but not track operators...yet)
2012:Sep:02:AM:04:02
	+	files now load correctly.  added flip y and spline reverse functions for more flexibility.  
	+	made two new tracks.  one is like kindga ka, and the other is called "tornado", modeled loosely 
		after the coney island cyclone and other six flags clones.  it would be nice to have woodie track 
		to go with it...
	+	TODO: i think banking will come next...
2012:Sep:05:AM:03:28
	+	TODO: fix supports so they don't hit underneath track
	+	TODO: fix file parser so that it uses a stack and can put fields out of order.
2012:Sep:06:AM:10:47
	+	moved speed control values from track operator to individual blocks.
	+	added trim and target blocks.  trim blocks brake always, and target blocks brake or 
		boost, depending on current speed, to get to target speed
	+	messed around with track mesh.  reorganized some code, but didn't add much functionality.
		should be easier to change in the future.  
2012:Sep:10:PM:07:51
	+	Made "Mega" track.  Defined some new elements like lasso turn and helix
	+	full circuit gap at the end of track is improved, but still looks a little off.  At least there is
		no "bump" now.
	+	Made "Corky" track.
	+	TODO: now that most function is included, it's either time for more track styles, adding car meshes,
	         or adding track details like chain lifts and catwalks.
2012:Sep:13:PM:10:14
	+	Modified skinny tube supports so that they have a pointed meeting point with the track.
	+	track crossbar segments stretch to the length of the track.
2012:Sep:22:PM:03:56
	+	Started added new Track Operation modes and stages to those modes.  Still working things out...
	+	TODO: finish working out track modes and their stages.
	+	implement full stops and waits in TrackOperator.
2012:Sep:23:PM:06:08
	+	small power outage; almost lost some work.
	+	tested 4 operation modes and they seem to work fine.  now to add full stops and station loads...
