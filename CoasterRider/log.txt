	+	added some track functions and yesterday i added track mesh.
	+	track length now seems to work
2012:Aug:15:PM:08:11
	+	track draws now, but it takes too long to wrap the spline to the mesh points
	+	consider some type of lookup table for mapping progress to up vectors
		(use approximation if needed. )
	+	TODO: Make  a heading approximation table for distance progressions along the track.  
	+	TODO: make a similar point approximation table with more entries.
	+	TODO: give Track::GetElmtStartHeadingAndPt() an extra boolean flag parameter to 
			   use a lookup table or not
	+	TODO: make a table for element start headings and 
	+	TODO: add a boolean flag parameter to Track::GetElmtStartHeadingAndPt() to use 
				a lookup table or not.
2012:Aug:17:PM:07:52
	+	Added tables to optimize the spline wrapping (still somewhat slow)
	+	added TrackMesh::UpdateNormals() to be called in accordance with spline wrapper.
	+	Fixed camera and lighting
	+	Defined some splines for hills and quarter turns.
	+	Added startbank to Track class and exitbank to PathSpline.  
	+	NOTE: banking will not affect the permanent orientation of the spline from element 
	   to element, but will affect heading of track and vehicle at any given point along 
	   the track.
	+	TODO: apply the new banking values to GetHeadingAt function somehow.
	+	TODO: fix the corkscrew up vectors.  They look off...
	+	TODO: Distance2Scale in PathSpline
2012:Aug:19:AM:03:02
	+	finally added the project to github under "DreamCoasterRider"
	+	TODO: need to add supports next.  These should be easy:
		[]	just check intervals along the track for up vectors have positive Y values.
		[]	on positive Y-valued up vectors, move DOWN the up vector a little (it should 
		   touch the track, and add a vertical support tube mesh from that point to the 
		   ground.
		[] Just put all the code in a TrackMesh::AddSupport() function with progress point
			and color as the primary arguments. 
	+	added a sky bowl.
	+	added a flat terrain.  both were easy to do in irrlicht.
	+	it is already looking like a real track.  gotta keep going though.
2012:Aug:20:AM:09:46
	+	added displays for speed, position and track length
	+	TODO: I added full circuit code, but i need to fix the lengths.  It freezes at the end of the track.  
2012:Aug:22:AM:03:47
	+	Tried multiple tracks in one scene.  Got really slow after 5 or so.
	+	The track length is better, but still has a way to go.
	+	Still need to do a Distance2Scale in FullSpline.  spline scale is not consistent with linear distance.
		I think using the ratios of three control point spans (|AB|,|BC|,|CD|) to the total span would 
		be close enough of an approximation without being too slow.
2012:Aug:28:AM:05:15
	+	TrackOperator class added, along with Train, Block, and Car classes.  
	+	TrackOperator::MoveTrain() handles the physics for now...
	+	Haven't yet updated the camera to move with the new Functions.  Still some things to test and take 
	   care of.
	+	TODO: need to process time in milliseconds and pass the time elapsed to TrackOperator::MoveTrain().
		Maybe Irrlicht has something for this.
